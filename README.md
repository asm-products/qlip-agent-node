# [Qlip](https://github.com/asm-products/qlip) (Node.js Agent)

This is an Agent for [Qlip](https://github.com/asm-products/qlip) written in Node.js.

## What is this for?
* A proof-of-concept of any idea that we're going to add to Agents.
* It's an example of how to connect to Qlip station and talk to its APIs.
* We can use Node.js compilers when we want to test Agents of different platforms before release.
  * E.g. [nexe](https://github.com/crcn/nexe) to compile it for Linux, Mac or Windows.
